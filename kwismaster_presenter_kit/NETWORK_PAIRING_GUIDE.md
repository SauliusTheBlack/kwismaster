# Network Pairing Guide for Scorekeeper

This guide explains how to connect the **Display Station** (presenting laptop) with the **Entry Station** (correction laptop) so they can share scores in real-time during your quiz event.

## What You Need

- 2 laptops (Display Station and Entry Station)
- 1 USB stick (for transferring files between laptops)

## Overview

The pairing process uses **2 files** to establish a secure connection:

You transfer these files using a USB stick (no internet required!).

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection failed" or "Not connected"

- **Check network:** Make sure both laptops are on the same WiFi or connected to the same network
- **Restart the process:** Click "Disconnect" and start over from Step 1
- **Check files:** Make sure you're uploading the correct files (.pair on Entry, .pair2 on Display)

### "No pairing data available"

- You need to click "Download Pairing File" or "Download Response File" first
- If you closed the dialog, click "Setup Network Sync" again and start over

### Files not downloading

- **Check your browser:** Make sure downloads are enabled
- **Check Downloads folder:** The files might be there already
- **Try again:** Close the dialog and restart the pairing process

### USB stick not recognized

- **Wait a moment:** Sometimes USB sticks take a few seconds to appear
- **Try different port:** Plug the USB stick into a different USB port
- **Check the stick:** Make sure the USB stick works and isn't full

### Taking too long

- **Be patient:** The system allows up to 10 minutes for file transfers
- **Don't close the browser:** Keep the scorekeeper page open while transferring files
- **Don't click "Cancel":** Wait for the process to complete

## Tips for Success

✓ **Keep dialogs open:** Don't close the browser or scorekeeper while pairing

✓ **Use the same USB stick:** This makes it easier to find your files

✓ **Label your laptops:** Put a sticky note on each laptop (Display/Entry) so you don't mix them up

✓ **Test before the event:** Do a practice run the day before your quiz event

✓ **Take your time:** There's no rush - the system will wait for you

## What Happens After Connection?

Once connected:

- **Entry Station:** Enter scores here during the quiz
- **Display Station:** Shows updated scores automatically
- **Both laptops:** Can see real-time score updates

The connection stays active until:
- You click "Disconnect"
- You close the browser
- You restart the laptop
- Network connection is lost

If you need to reconnect, just repeat the pairing process!

## Still Having Problems?

If nothing works:
1. Close both browsers completely
2. Restart both laptops
3. Make sure both are on the same network
4. Try the pairing process again from Step 1

The pairing files (.pair and .pair2) are only valid for one pairing session. If something goes wrong, you need to generate new files by starting over.
